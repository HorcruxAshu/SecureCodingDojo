  ('Cross-site Scripting'). Please review that section to refresh your memory and also the OWASP link below.

<h5>Challenge Tips and Tricks</h5>
<ul>
<li>
Reveal the source ip of the chat users by storing a hidden image into the chat messages on that page.
It must be <strong>exactly</strong> this html snippet <code>&lt;img src='https://gov.logger.good' width='0px'&gt;</code> . 
You will find out that you can inject more than just images, but only that particular html snippet will unlock the challenge.
</li><li>
Analyze the source of the page carefully. You'll notice that XSS is mostly prevented by using Angular templates, except for one particular case.
</li><li>
Take a look in the Network tab of your browser debugger. Some of the last entries in messages.json should be very interesting. Some messages are hidden.
</li><li>
There's some handy javascript functions in that page to help you out. Simply calling one of these functions from the browser console will generate the type of message you need. 
</li><li>
Did you know that your browser lets you copy some of the network requests as a curl command? You should be able to copy the request to put a regular message and replace the message object with the one generated from the console.
</li><li>
If your challenge code expires, simply resubmit the curl request and reload the messages. Confirm that you have a new challenge code.
